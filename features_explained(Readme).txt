Explanation of Features:
Cushion Effect :
The box-shadow property creates the illusion of depth and light interaction.
On hover, the button slightly compresses (scale(0.95) and translateY) to mimic the feeling of pressing down on a cushion.
On click (:active), the button compresses further, enhancing the tactile feedback.
Light and Shadow Play :
Shadows are adjusted dynamically to simulate the way light interacts with a soft surface.
Inset shadows (inset) are used to create highlights and lowlights inside the button.
Smooth Transitions :
CSS transitions ensure that the changes in size, position, and shadow are smooth and visually appealing.
Interactive Behavior :
JavaScript enhances the interactivity by allowing dynamic adjustments during hover and click events.
